# drinkdotcom

This is an E-commerce website for Drinks, I created for my Master Final year project. DrinkDotCom is an extendable.adaptable eCommerce project developed with C# ASP.NET MVC
framework. It has all the features a fully function online shopping website requires.

I used Entity Framework Code first approach to develop DrinkDotCom, so it can support a wide range of database providers.

Some of the features:
- Simple and Easy eCommerce
- Product and Category catalog
- Comments and Ratings review
- Promo Discount Management
- Users and Roles management
- Configuration management
- Order management
- Order invoice generation
- Admin Dashboard
- Payment Methods Integration
